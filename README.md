Essentially, recreate on your own a very simple program or reuse the code from the previous Docker example or assignment that demonstrates successfully setting up your project to use these tools.  There is no requirement for the code other than it is Python and works.  You can reuse the code from the video as well.

**Requirements:**

Submit a link to the project's Github repository and a screenshot of the project running in Pycharm. 
Have at least 3 commits to show the steps you took to create the project. 
Label your commits (Fix, Feature, Task) i.e. "Task: Created Dockerfile".
